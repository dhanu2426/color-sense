# COLORSENSE-A-Web-tool-for-color-detection-and-recommendation

    COLORSENSE is a web application that seamlessly combines technology and creativity to explore the world of colors. It allows users to upload images and 
    interactively identify colors by hovering their mouse over the image, displaying the corresponding RGB and HEX values in real-time. Additionally, users can input 
    their current emotion, and the application generates a personalized color palette designed to complement or enhance that emotion.it can also take the rgb values 
    as input and provide complementary and analogous colors for better color combinations

    This is my own idea which lead to my very first solo project which helped me to understand the better 
    implementation of HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT.

    Thank uh for reading !
